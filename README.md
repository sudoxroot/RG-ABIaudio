# RG-ABIaudio

A small Python project for the school to be able to download Youtube songs for the ABI award


## How to run the script 🧑‍💻

```
python3 index.pyw
```

### complications:

Libraries that are not installed by default are required for execution. These are displayed as an error message when trying to run `index.pyw`. These can simply be installed later via pip.
The program is not written very efficiently and effectively and has only been tested on Windows 11.
