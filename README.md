## How to run the script üßë‚Äçüíª

```
python3 index.pyw
```

### complications:

Libraries that are not installed by default are required for execution. These are displayed as an error message when trying to run `index.pyw`. These can simply be installed later via pip. In addition, VLC must be installed.
The program is not written very efficiently and effectively and has only been tested on Windows 11.

## current audio-file output:

The current file output is `[number]-[start time(in seconds)]-[Name(Multiple names separated by "_")].wav`
